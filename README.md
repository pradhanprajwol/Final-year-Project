Smart Agriculture System (IoT-based Automated Irrigation)

📌 Project Overview

The Smart Agriculture System is an IoT-driven solution developed as my Final Year Project to address the challenges of traditional irrigation methods. By leveraging real-time data from soil moisture sensors, the system automates the water supply to crops, ensuring optimal growth while significantly reducing water wastage.

🚀 Key Features

Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracks soil moisture levels using high-precision sensors.

Automated Irrigation: Logic-driven water pump activation that triggers only when moisture falls below a programmable threshold.

Smart Alert System: Integrated notification protocols to alert users about critical soil conditions or hardware status.

Resource Optimization: Reduces manual labor and promotes sustainable water usage through data-driven automation.
